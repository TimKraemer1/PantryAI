## **Project Overview**

PantryAI Virtual Pantry aims to simplify pantry management by allowing users to scan grocery items, track their expiration, and generate recipe recommendations based on available ingredients. The app leverages a combination of manual entry and external APIs to maintain an up-to-date list of pantry contents.

## **Features**
- **UPC Scanning**: Users can scan items via UPC codes, fetching details from the [Nutritionix API](https://www.nutritionix.com/).
- **Manual Item Entry**: Items that cannot be scanned can be manually added to the pantry.
- **UUID Tracking**: Each pantry item is uniquely identified by a UUID for efficient database operations.
- **Recipe Recommendations**: The app recommends recipes based on the items you have in stock.
- **Stock Tracking**: Track item quantities and expiration dates.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors like API failures or missing product details.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional, depending on how youâ€™ve set up data persistence)
